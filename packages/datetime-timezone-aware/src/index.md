@# (EXPERIMENTAL) Datetime-timezone-aware

The [__@blueprintjs/datetime-timezone-aware__ NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/datetime)
provides components for interacting with date and time with timezones. This library is experimental and the API is likely to break in further revisions.

- [`DateInput`](#datetime/dateinput), which composes a text input with a `DatePicker` and `TimeZonePicker` in
  a `Popover`, for use in forms.


Make sure to review the [getting started docs for installation info](#blueprint/getting-started).

```sh
npm install --save @blueprintjs/datetime-timezone-aware
```

Import CSS with a JS bundler like webpack:

```js
@import "~@blueprintjs/datetime-timezone-aware/lib/css/blueprint-datetime.css";
```

...or in plain HTML:

```html
<link href="path/to/node_modules/@blueprintjs/datetime-timezone-aware/lib/css/blueprint-datetime.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

@page timezone-picker
