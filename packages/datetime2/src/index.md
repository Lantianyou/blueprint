@# Timezone2


The [__@blueprintjs/datetime2__ NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blueprintjs/datetime)
provides components for interacting with date and time with timezones. This library is experimental and the API is likely to break in further revisions.

- [`DateInput2`](#/time-zone-aware-date-input), which renders a `DateInput` with a `TimezonePicker2` and show's the users selected time zone.

Make sure to review the [getting started docs for installation info](#blueprint/getting-started).

```sh
npm install --save @blueprintjs/datetime2
```

Import CSS with a JS bundler like webpack:

```js
@import "~@blueprintjs/datetime2/lib/css/blueprint-datetime.css";
```

...or in plain HTML:

```html
<link href="path/to/node_modules/@blueprintjs/datetime2/lib/css/blueprint-datetime.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

@page timezone-picker2
@page date-input2
